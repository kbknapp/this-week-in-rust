## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC 1651: Extend `Cell` to work with non-`Copy` types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1651).

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [Allow uncallable method impls to be omitted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1699).
* [Macros by example 2.0. A replacement for `macro_rules!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1584).

## Closed RFCs

Following proposals were rejected by [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) after their 'final comment period' elapsed.

* [Const-dependent type system (also known as, Î -types and value-types)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1657).
* [Add syntax for expressing tuples as a head and tail pair, similar to a Lisp cons cell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1582).

## New RFCs

* [Write to standard error with `eprint!` and `eprintln!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1869).
* [A portability lint](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1868).
* [Improve the `assert_eq` failure message formatting to increase legibility](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1866).
* [Add official Gitter and Slack channels to compliment our official IRC channels](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1865).
* [Add `extern type` declarations for declaring types from external libraries which have an unknown size/layout](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1861).
* [Include the `ManuallyDrop` wrapper in `core::mem`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1860).
* [Extend `?` to operate over other types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1859).
* [Add built-in trait `Move` which all existing types will implement. Types which do not implement it cannot move after they have been borrowed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1858).
* [Add metadata to diagnostic messages' json output](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1855).
* [Stabilize drop order](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1857).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

PRs:

* [match](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/56)
* [type aliases](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/55)
* [structs and unions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/pull/53)

Ready for PR:

There's [a lot of them](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready-for-PR) right now, contributions here would be very welcome. If you want advice or help getting started, please ping nrc, or any other member of the style team, in #rust-style.

Issues in final comment period:

* [Whitespace in associated type syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/51).
* [`..` vs `_`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/49).
* [function declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/39).
* [enum declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/31).
* [generics declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/29).

Other significant issues:

* [types](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/15)
* [closures](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/35)
* [where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/38)
* [`extern` vs `extern "C"`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/52)

# Quote of the Week

> Yeah, it's like learning to dance when your partner [borrow checker] already knows all the steps. When you're just getting started, you step on their toes a lot, but over time you get the motions down. Eventually, you can start to anticipate their movements and start to appreciate the music as part of the dance, instead of just concentrating on getting your feet in the right place.
